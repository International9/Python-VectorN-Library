About:
-
A Python Library Created For Represeting Different Vector Systems (2D, 3D & 4D Vectors)

Heavily Inspired By Unity's Ones To Make People's Life Easier Instead Of Them Needing To Handle Positions Manually Or Use Lists.

Also Has Static Functions Such As: 'Dot', 'Angle', 'Distance' Etc... To Again - Stop Manually Having To Write These Functions.

- Class For Vector4Int

Vector Representations For 2D, 3D And 4D Including Variants Of Them To Handle Integers.


Installation Instructions:
-

**Easiest Way**
  In The Commad Prompt: 
  
    "pip install git+https://github.com/International9/Python-VectorN-Library/tree/main/VectorLibrary"
    

**Possible To Use Manual/Local Installation (Requires git):**

  1.) Download Or Clone The Directory Using This Line In Cmd: 
  
    "git clone https://github.com/International9/Python-VectorN-Library.git"
  
  2.) Navigate Into The Cloned Project Folder:

    "cd (Directory Of Library Just Cloned)"

  3.) Then Just:

    "pip install ."


Support:
-
As Of Now The Vector Types Can Support Multiple Different Functionallities Such As:
- Operators: Addition, Division, Multiplication, Subtruction Etc..
- Casting To String.
- Static Methods: Dot, Angle, Distance, Max And Min Functions.
- Shorthand For Writing Different Vector (I.E: 'one', 'zero', 'left', 'right' Etc..) Like In Unity's Version.
